# Speech Recognition in Python
A fun project that parses a .wav audio file into text.

This projects uses the [SpeechRecognition]([https://link-url-here.org](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) library to perform the speech recognition. 

A simple Flask app was set up to provide an interface to upload a .wav file. 
We then post that data to the program and record and recognise the audio file before passing it through the Google Speech Recognition engine for transcription.
